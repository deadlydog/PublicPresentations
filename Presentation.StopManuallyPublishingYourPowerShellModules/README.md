# Stop manually publishing your PowerShell modules presentation

The slide deck for the presentation I gave at the [PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit](https://www.powershellsummit.org/) in April 2024.
You can [watch the video recording here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_2sOE9Y6g).

The presentation is about how to easily automate publishing your PowerShell modules from a pipeline, and the benefits of doing so.
