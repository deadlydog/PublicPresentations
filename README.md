# 🗣️ Daniel Schroeder's Public Presentations

This repository hosts some public presentations that I have given, including slide decks and other resources, as well as links to video recordings when available.

Each presentation has its own directory with a README.md file that provides more information about the presentation, such as where and when it was given, and any relevant resources.

I will update this repository with new presentations as I give them, so feel free to check back for updates!

Check out [my blog](https://blog.danskingdom.com/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/deadlydog/featured) for more content as well.
