# Daniel Schroeder's Public Presentations 🗣️

This repository hosts some public presentations that I have given since 2024, including slide decks and other resources, as well as links to video recordings when available.

I will update this repository with new presentations as I give them, so feel free to check back for updates!

Check out [my blog](https://blog.danskingdom.com/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/deadlydog/featured) for more content as well.
